# Stocks Service

## Overview:
This service implements a proxy server of the Alpha Vantage API for historical stock data. Written in Go, I created an adapter to consume and adjust the API data for my own needs. There are several gRPC methods to get data related to any stock tracked on Alpha Vantage.
